Speak a Prophetic (word) Message
We all communicate to get our point across or pass on information.
In communication we have the verbal and non verbal. Though both can be said to be means of communication, more emphasis is placed on either the written or verbal communication. This is so because non verbal communication can be misunderstood due to cultural differences. 
What you say during, most of the time or something depict the stand you have taken in a particular situation which largely affects the how event will unfold.
A prophetic word is not your word but is a word the Lord has for you. To access it you have to be on the frequency of the Lord and then access it and speak it.
In every situation you fine yourself in, it is best to  hear from God first.
God speaks and every work the Lord speaks is prophetic.
It is easy to say all the good things when all is going well but the opposite is not same.
